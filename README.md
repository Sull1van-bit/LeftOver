## Inspiration
Our inspiration for creating LeftOver came from Surplus, a movement that encourages people not to waste leftover food carelessly. We realized that many people around us still throw away food that could actually can be repurposed or processed into something more enjoyable. Through LeftOver, we want to help reduce food waste pollution by promoting better food management.
## What it does
The LeftOver app serves as a platform for users, such as people at home who are unsure what to do with leftover food or are looking for affordable meals that still have nearly the same quality as fresh food. LeftOver is also integrated with AI, which helps users find suitable recipes. For restaurant owners, the app provides a way to sell their surplus food, and it also helps calculate deadstock to avoid overproduction in the future.
## How we built it
As a team we have different role like Front end and back end, we used like :
1.	React : for making responsive and interactive website so user was satisfied with our web.
2.	Vite : for optimized the website.
3.	TailWinds CSS : for Customize our website way more effective and way more unique.
4.	SupaBase: for a realtime database
5.	Gemini AI : Gemini AI supports the AI functionalities within the application
## Challenges we ran into
We faced many challenges during development. On the backend side, we struggled with the programming language, which pushed us to learn and adapt quickly. We also realized how important time management is, especially when working under deadlines. Additionally, we learned the value of communication, as at first we worked more like individuals. However, as time went on, our teamwork improved significantly.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of the accomplishments we’re most proud of as a team is being able to bring our ideas to life by building an app that matched our imagination, complete with a UI/UX design that we genuinely love. We're also proud that we successfully integrated AI into our project for the first time.

## What we learned
During GarudaHack, we learned the importance of teamwork and good communication. Despite the challenges, we truly enjoyed the experience—especially being able to laugh and grow together. We also learned how to write code more effectively, the value of choosing simpler languages or tools, and not being afraid to ask mentors for help, which really made a difference. Most importantly, we learned how to build an application with the right workflow, which helped us stay organized and avoid unnecessary stress.

## What's next for LeftOver
Moving forward, we definitely want to keep developing LeftOver. We plan to make the app more real-time, improve its user-friendliness, and fix the remaining bugs. In the long term, our goal is to make LeftOver widely used and become a movement that encourages people to reduce food waste and take better care of the environment.
